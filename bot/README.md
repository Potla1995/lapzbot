###Modules list
Hello there. The fact that you ventured inside this folder means that you are interested in the working of lapzbot :D. Worry not, here's what each of these files do :

* `chatemotes.py` : Contains the emoticons library. If you know basic python, you will probably be able to edit this and add your own emotes.
* `eightball.py` : Codes for the `8ball` module.
* `guessgame.py` : Codes for the `guess` module.
* `lapzbot.py` : The boss file
* `musicplayer.py` : Codes that turn lapzbot into a cool music player 
* `osu.py` : Codes for `stats` and `top` module.
* `triviagame.py` : Codes for `quiz` module

If you happen to write any modules for lapzbot remember to send me a pull request.
