## lapzbot

### What is lapzbot?
lapzbot is a multi-purpose utility bot that I wrote for my discord server `osu! India`. Needless to say the functions I have created are designed keeping the osu crowd in mind. If you want to use this bot, go ahead and use it. I will try to keep it as updated as possible.

### How to set it up?
1. Install [Python 3.5.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Make sure you select this option in the Python install: **Install launchers for all user** and **Add Python 3.5 to PATH**. After that do **Install Now**. (*Don't click on Customize installation*) 
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
3. Download the **async version** of [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/async)
    * Alternatively, open comamnd prompt and type `pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@async` . P.S. This requires Python and Git to be installed first. So complete steps 1 and 2 before doing this.
4. Download the bot by clicking on **Download ZIP** near the top right hand side of this site
5. Unzip the bot
6. Goto the bot folder once you have unzipped, and double-click the `lapzbot.py` file. (In case that doesnt work, right click 'lapzbot.py' and open it with IDLE. Then from IDLE, press `F5` )


### Command list
