### What is lapzbot?
lapzbot is a multi-purpose utility bot that I wrote for my discord server `osu! India`. Needless to say the functions I have created are designed keeping the osu crowd in mind. If you want to use this bot, go ahead and use it. I will try to keep it as updated as possible.

### How to set it up?
